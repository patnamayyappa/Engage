        <h1>About Success Planning<a name="kanchor9"></a></h1>
        <p>Success planning is a framework in which members of faculty and students collaborate to formulate student plans and activities.  Success planning can  happen based on student grades, academic goals, student self-skilling targets, completing specific tasks, and so on. Examples when success plans can be formulated are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">When student grades are below a threshold score, faculty can assign success plans</li>
            <li value="2">When students are keen to gain additional skills in a specific area</li>
            <li value="3">When students are keen to learn new skills that are not included in their curriculum</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>About Success Plan Templates and Success Plans</h5>
        <p>Faculty or student advisors can create success plan template or success plan records. A success plan is a group of activities assigned to a specific student and the advisor. Success plans can be created with or without a success plan template.</p>
        <p>A success plan template is a reusable group of activities that can be assigned to multiple students. When it's assigned to a student, a new success plan record is created for the student with the latterâ€™s name appended to the success plan template name. After assignment, both the success plan template and success plan can be modified without affecting each other.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;font-weight: bold;">Success Plan records</p>
        <h5>About Success Plan To Do Templates and To Dos</h5>
        <p>  A success plan to do template is a template of an activity to be performed. The To Do is the actual activity which will be performed.</p>
        <p>When the success plan template (including its success plan to do template) is assigned to a student, a copy of the success plan to do template is automatically created, which is a To Do record. </p>
        <p>To Do records can also be created in  scenarios outside of success plan records  when a task needs to be assigned to a student and it's not required to create a success plan as an associated record. </p>
        <p>Success plan to do templates are reusable activities that can be assigned to a student. A To Do is a specific activity that a student or advisor will complete. After assignment, unique changes can be made to either record without affecting the related record.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;font-weight: bold;">Success Plan To Do Template records</p>
        <h5>Exception Scenarios</h5>
        <p>Success plans can be created independently (outside of success plan templates) in scenarios where there is a specific need, i.e., the scenario being addressed by the student advisor and / or the student is  unique. Similarly, To Do records can be created  outside of success plan records when a specific task needs to be assigned to a student and it's not required to create a success plan as an associated record. To Dos can be added to an existing success plan even if the success plans are created from a success plan template.</p>
